NOTE: SET THE PATH OF YOUR WORKING DIRECTORY IN THE setwd() in runnable.R
NOTE: If runnable.R dosen't work then steps to run the code
1) source Initialization.R, hog.R, lbp.R glcm.R
2) Acc to method selected run  run_hog.R, run_lbp.R, run_glcm.R
3)Similarly acc to classification algo selected run algoname_methodname.R
